 <h3>1. The File called <em>DecimalFractionToBinary.java</em> will be converting floating point numbers to equivalent binary numbers according to the following question:<br></h3>

 <p><i>Write a program (Java or C++) to convert from decimal notation to binary notation for thirty (30) 
 randomly generated floating-point numbers with at most three decimal points e.g., 123.875. Your result
should give a list of randomly generated numbers, resulting binary notation and remarks column having
exactly or approximately (with at most five (5) decimal points) remark. Table Q1 (b) shows a sample of an 
expected results for 11.81 and 21.25 respectively.</p></i>
